    The sage accepts the World<br>
    As the World accepts Tao;<br>
    He does not display himself,<br>
    so is clearly seen,<br>
    Does not justify himself,<br>
    so is famed,<br>
    Does not boast,<br>
    so is credited,<br>
    Does not glory,<br>
    so excels,<br>
    Does not contend,<br>
    so no one contends against him.
