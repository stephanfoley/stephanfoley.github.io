<blockquote>
  <p>
    Those who wish to change the World<br>
    According with their desire<br>
    Cannot succeed.<br>
    The World is shaped by Tao;<br>
    It cannot be shaped by Self.<br>
    If one tries to shape it,<br>
    one damages it;<br>
    If one tries to possess it,<br>
    one loses it.<br><br>
    Therefore:<br>
    Sometimes things flourish,<br>
    And sometimes they do not.<br>
    Sometimes life is hard<br>
    And sometimes it is easy.<br>
    Sometimes people are strong<br>
    And sometimes they are weak.<br>
    Sometimes you get where you are going<br>
    And sometimes you fall by the way.<br><br>
    The sage is not extreme,<br>
    extravagant, or complacent.
